There are quite some free-of-cost cycling videos for bike trainers
on the web, e.g. at http://rlv.pcanywhere.com

They consist of regular AVI video files, often GPX routes, and
many of these come with extra files (PGMF etc.) for use with
the trainer's manufacturer-provided software. Trainers without
software support can still be used with the video alone, the
user just has to set the wattage manually.

This is a Makefile to play back the videos with mplayer and generate
some automated subtitles. Playback can be slowed down (or sped up)
so that the whole video takes a user-defined time.

The automatically-generated subtitle files are in SRT format and
contain time markers, like when you have reached a quarter, a third,
or half the total running time. These subtitle files can then be
augmented with information about the elevation profile of the route
in the video. E.g. at time 7:40, it could say "Steep climb in 20
seconds, lasting 70 seconds" so that the user is prepared.


Testing has been done with Ubuntu Linux 11.10.
